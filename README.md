# DQ-Analysis
1. Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
The purpose of this challenge as to refactor an excel VBA code that analysis green stocks from the year 2017. The code allows the user to choose what year to analyse and then see how each stock performed and make a decision on how to invest.  

2. Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.

To complete this challenegs, I coped the vba code and created the missing code, variables, arrays formatting and output.

The stocks in 2017 performed better than in 2018. The program run time in 2017 ran faster than in 2018.

ENPH and RUN are the strongest stocks and both receieved possible returns in 2017 and 2018 but both did love value in 2018 from 2017. The stocks that performed the worst was TERP. 

3. Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions.
What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
Some advantages of refactoring are having the oportunity to see how code works in different ways and formats. This will allow for a more dynamice way to map out a program and problem solve issues as they arrive. refactoring can also help the coder leanrt o sot patterns, where code is being reused and have the ability to find a faster or clear line of code. One disadvantage is that new issues will arise and will require time to go  
How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
One pro is that the variables became more specific and gear toward a ticker volume and not to a general volume. As the programmer, I know what the variables refer to but I can't assum the newxt person to see this program will immediately understand what the code is refering to.
